It looks like you've successfully re-added the submodule and moved it from `section04_Argo_CD/exercise` to `exercise` in the root of your repository, which is reflected in your commit output. Here's a breakdown of what happened and what you can do moving forward:

### What Happened:

1. **Submodule Addition**: You added the submodule again using `git submodule add --force git@github.com:marwiesing/GitOps_Argo_CD.git exercise`. The `--force` option ensured that the existing submodule configuration was overwritten, but it also triggered the local Git directory for the submodule (located in `exercise`) to be reused.

2. **Repository Structure Changes**: After committing the changes, it appears that the `exercise` submodule was successfully moved from `section04_Argo_CD/exercise` to just `exercise` at the root level, as indicated by the file deletions and renames in your commit (`rename section04_Argo_CD/exercise => exercise`).

3. **Commit and Push**: You pushed the changes to the remote repository, which means the structure of the repository now reflects the new location of the submodule.

### What to Do Next:

1. **Check `.gitmodules`**: Ensure that `.gitmodules` is correctly configured to reflect the new submodule path. It should look like this:

   ```ini
   [submodule "exercise"]
       path = exercise
       url = git@github.com:marwiesing/GitOps_Argo_CD.git
   ```

2. **Sync Submodules Again**: Now that the submodule is in the correct path, you should run the following to ensure everything is properly synchronized:

   ```bash
   git submodule sync
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

3. **Remove Old Submodule References (if needed)**: If you still see any remnants of the old submodule directory (e.g., `section04_Argo_CD/exercise`), you can clean it up by deleting the directory manually:

   ```bash
   rm -rf section04_Argo_CD/exercise
   ```

4. **Verify Repository Structure**: Confirm that the submodule is now located in the `exercise` folder at the root of your repository. You can check with:

   ```bash
   ls exercise
   ```

5. **Push Changes**: If you've made any additional changes or corrections, make sure to commit and push them.

   ```bash
   git add .gitmodules exercise
   git commit -m "Fix submodule path"
   git push
   ```

### Conclusion:

It seems that the submodule path change is correct, and the repository is now in a clean state. The crucial part is ensuring that the `.gitmodules` file is updated correctly and that the submodule is synchronized. If you follow the steps above, everything should be in order now. Let me know if you encounter any issues!
